Bugs/Glitches:
- you can go one block off screen
- walls will spawn ontop of the body
- extra lives number may randomly have infinite decimal places
- Obstacles may spawn on head or right infront of it resulting in death if only one life remaining

Hints/cheats:
-"Y" key activates win clause which shows the win screen
- "M" key adds 10 extra lives to your current lives (this can be used to test out collision and life loss when colliding)
- "N" key resets your lives to 1 (this can be used to test out collision and life loss when colliding)
- "Q" key stops all movement in the snake but will result in death when obstacles are turned on (since you won't have infinite lives)

Differences from orignal plan:
- Didn't do two seperate maps, changed up how power ups work (instead of spawning really late in game you will need to collect 10 to get 1 extra life)

Key important info:
- snake can be controlled with wasd, ijkl and arrow keys
- obstacles can be toggled on and off in settings, when turned off snake can collide with body without loss of lives, in that mode only way to lose lives is collide with wall.
- snake will be moved back a few blocks when hitting wall
- when snake is longer and you phase through its whole body you will lose the body's length amount of lives
